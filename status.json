If url already exists, do not insert a new row.\n- Also store the category association so cached queries are per-category.\n\nValidation rules:\n- category: trimmed, lowercase, length 2..32, allowed characters: letters, digits, space, hyphen.\n- url: must be a valid http(s) URL.\n- published_at: must parse as datetime.\n\nE2E test (closed loop, real internet):\n- Start frontend + backend locally.\n- Browser test steps:\n  1) open the app\n  2) type \u0027science\u0027 in Category\n  3) click Fetch\n  4) wait until status line becomes one of FRESH/CACHED/PARTIAL and results render\n  5) assert the UI renders between 1 and 10 items\n  6) for each rendered item assert: title visible, description visible, link has non-empty href starting with http, published_at is displayed\n  7) assert each rendered published_at is within the last 7 days (UTC) relative to test runtime\n\nOut of scope:\n- Auth/users, pagination, saving favorites, complex styling, admin panels.",
